I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch

I've been drivin' in LA
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life
Like you're not really happy
But you don't wanna die
Like you're hanging by a thread
But you gotta survive cuz u gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like your fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair

A little bit tired of tryin' to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin'
There's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin'
Tryna stay afloat
So I got these
Quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke

The prescriptions on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy I wish that I could count

Cuz I just wanna see
If this could make me happy

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hanging by a thread
But you gotta survive cuz ya gotta survive

Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like your fresh outta love
But it's been in the air
Am I past repair

A little bit tired of tryin' to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinking
There's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin'
Tryna stay afloat
So I got these
Quick repairs to cope

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like a numb little bug that's gotta survive
That's gotta survive
